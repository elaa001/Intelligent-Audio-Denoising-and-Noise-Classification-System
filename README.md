# Intelligent-Audio-Denoising-and-Noise-Classification-System
This project removes various background noises (e.g. impulsive, chirps, continuous) from audio files using STFT-based masking and automatic noise classification. It also visualizes power spectral density and spectrograms for original, noisy, and cleaned signals with dynamic filtering strategies.
